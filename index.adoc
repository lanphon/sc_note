== Welcome to SystemC Code Review

This repository contains a comprehensive code review and analysis of the SystemC library, covering its core concepts, architecture, and TLM (Transaction Level Modeling) framework.

[abstract]
== Overview

This book provides a comprehensive code review of the SystemC library. It serves as both an in-depth analysis and an introduction to mastering SystemC programming.

The book is organized as follows:

First, we introduce the concept of coroutines and the QuickThread library implementation used in SystemC, which serves as the foundation for understanding SystemC thread scheduling. Next, we cover the SystemC kernel scheduling model, including the delta cycle concept composed of EVALUATE, UPDATE, and NOTIFICATION phases.

After gaining an overview of kernel scheduling, we dedicate three chapters to introduce Events, SystemC Threads, and Primitive Channels—these are the three main components that participate in kernel scheduling. We then introduce Port, an essential component for SystemC hierarchical organization, and provide specific guidance on setting up sensitivity sources. This is followed by a chapter on miscellaneous SystemC topics covering small components that don't fit into previous sections. We then discuss Trace and synthesis aspects. At this point, the basic SystemC introduction concludes. We devote a separate chapter to rethink SystemC design philosophy, attempting to summarize its design concepts.

Since the subsequent TLM introduction primarily concerns interfaces, ports, and exports, before formally starting TLM, we revisit SystemC interfaces, ports, and exports to understand their design philosophy. The second part of the book focuses on TLM. First is the TLM 1.0 introduction, which is relatively simple and can be covered in one chapter. TLM 2.0 is divided into introduction, simple sockets, other sockets, and concludes with a TLM miscellaneous section.

This code review is based on SystemC 2.3.3 source code.
